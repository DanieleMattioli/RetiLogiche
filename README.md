# RetiLogiche
Repository of the project developed for the "Prova Finale di Reti Logiche" (Final test of Logic Arrays) course, part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

This final test aims at assessing the students ability to implement an algorithm on a low-level hardware language such as VHDL, under time and memory constraints on a FPGA.
